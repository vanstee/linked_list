Linked List in C
----------------

After watching [@garybernhardt](https://github.com/garybernhardt) test drive
some C code in [A Bit of C](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/a-bit-of-c),
I thought it might be fun to try it out on my own. This is the result.
Considering I'm still pretty new to C this code is probably pretty bad. Don't use it.
